# Market Basket Analysis with Recommendation System

This project explores **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** to discover item associations from transaction data and uses those insights to power a simple **recommendation system**. The notebook walks through data preparation, exploratory analysis, association rule mining concepts (support, confidence, lift), and generating actionable product recommendations.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Retailers and e-commerce platforms want to understand which products are frequently purchased together so they can:
- Improve cross-selling and bundling
- Optimize shelf layout and promotions
- Personalize product recommendations

This repo demonstrates an end-to-end MBA workflow using Python.

---

## ✨ What’s Inside
- Clean & transform transaction data into a basket format
- Compute key MBA metrics: **support**, **confidence**, **lift**
- Visualize item frequencies and rule relationships
- Build a lightweight **recommendation function** based on learned associations
- Evaluate rules and sanity-check recommendations

> Put your dataset (e.g., `data/transactions.csv`) under a `data/` folder and update paths in the notebook if needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis-recsys.git
cd market-basket-analysis-recsys
```

### 2) Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Launch the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/market-basket-analysis-using-recommendation-system.ipynb
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Support**: Frequency of an itemset in all transactions  
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of item B being purchased when item A is purchased  
- **Lift**: How much more likely A and B occur together than if independent  

---

## 📊 Typical Outputs
- Top-N frequent items and item pairs
- Association rules table with support, confidence, and lift
- Plots of item frequencies / rule strengths
- A simple `recommend(items)` helper that returns “people who bought X also bought Y”

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Sanity Checks
- Validate rules with **lift > 1**
- Hold-out or time-based split to check recommendation quality (optional)
- Manual inspection of popular item bundles
