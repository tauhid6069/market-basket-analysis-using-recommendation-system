## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Retailers and e-commerce platforms often want to know: *“Which products are likely to be purchased together?”*  

By answering this, they can:  
- Improve **cross-selling and bundling**  
- Optimise **shelf layout and promotions**  
- Personalise **product recommendations**  

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for MBA and recommendation building using Python.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

**Co-occurrence matrix:** Identifies items frequently purchased together

**Collaborative filtering:** Uses item similarity to suggest related products

**Recommendation function:** Returns “people who bought X also bought Y”
